Testing a **proxy contract** and the **ERC20 logic contract** involves ensuring both components work correctly and interact seamlessly in an upgradeable setup. Here are the possible test cases categorized by the contracts and their functionality:

---

### **Proxy Contract Test Cases**
1. **Deployment**
   - Ensure the proxy contract is deployed successfully.
   - Verify that the implementation (logic) address is set correctly.

2. **Initialization**
   - Ensure the `initialize` function can only be called once.
   - Verify that calling `initialize` with incorrect parameters fails.

3. **Delegation**
   - Ensure calls to the proxy are properly delegated to the logic contract.
   - Verify that state changes through the proxy are stored in the proxy’s storage.

4. **Upgradeable Functionality**
   - Deploy a new implementation and upgrade the proxy to use it.
   - Verify that the proxy maintains the original state after the upgrade.
   - Ensure that the proxy uses the new implementation's logic after the upgrade.
   - Test events emitted during the upgrade (e.g., `Upgraded`).

5. **Access Control**
   - Ensure only authorized accounts (e.g., owner/admin) can upgrade the proxy.
   - Verify unauthorized accounts cannot call `upgradeTo` or similar functions.

6. **Fallback Functionality**
   - Test that the proxy's fallback function correctly delegates calls to the logic contract.
   - Ensure the proxy reverts for unsupported functions or invalid inputs.

### **ERC20 Logic Contract Test Cases**
1. **Basic ERC20 Functionality**
   - Test `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`.
   - Verify the total supply, initial balances, and minting/burning logic.
   - Test `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions.
   - Ensure allowance mechanisms (`approve`, `increaseAllowance`, `decreaseAllowance`) work as expected.

2. **State Interaction via Proxy**
   - Verify `balanceOf` and `allowance` are updated correctly when interacting through the proxy.
   - Test transfers, approvals, and allowances through the proxy.

3. **Storage Consistency**
   - Ensure the proxy maintains the same storage structure as the ERC20 logic contract.
   - Test that all state variables are correctly preserved across upgrades.

4. **Upgradeable Features**
   - Deploy a new version of the ERC20 logic contract with additional functionality (e.g., a new method).
   - Upgrade the proxy and ensure the new functionality is accessible.
   - Verify backward compatibility of the previous functions after the upgrade.

5. **Reverts and Edge Cases**
   - Test for revert conditions like transferring more than the balance or approving invalid values.
   - Verify that functions revert when called with invalid inputs or states.

---

### **Combined Proxy + Logic Test Cases**
1. **Deployment and Initialization**
   - Test that deploying the proxy with the logic contract initializes both correctly.
   - Verify that the `initialize` function of the logic contract works only when called via the proxy.

2. **State Management**
   - Test that all state changes (e.g., balances, allowances) are reflected properly in the proxy's storage.
   - Verify no state is stored in the logic contract.

3. **Upgrade Impact**
   - Test that upgrading to a new logic contract does not corrupt the proxy's state.
   - Ensure that previously accessible state variables (e.g., `balances`) remain intact after an upgrade.

4. **Event Emission**
   - Test that events (e.g., `Transfer`, `Approval`) are emitted correctly when interacting via the proxy.
   - Verify `Upgraded` or other relevant events are emitted during upgrades.

5. **Access Control**
   - Ensure only the admin/owner can upgrade the proxy or perform administrative tasks.
   - Verify access control mechanisms in the logic contract still function correctly via the proxy.

6. **Edge Cases**
   - Test upgrading to an invalid or malicious logic contract.
   - Test interactions with the proxy before the logic contract is set (should revert).

---

### **Examples of Custom Tests**
1. **Add a Pausable Feature**  
   - Test pausing/unpausing the token through the proxy.
   - Ensure all token transfers are disabled when paused.

2. **Introduce a Fee Mechanism in an Upgrade**  
   - Test the token before upgrading (no fee logic).
   - Upgrade the proxy to a logic contract with fee deduction.
   - Verify fee calculations and deductions.

3. **Contract Destruction and Recovery**  
   - Verify the proxy cannot be self-destructed.
   - Test that destructing the logic contract doesn’t affect the proxy.

4. **Gas Optimization**  
   - Benchmark gas usage before and after upgrades.
   - Ensure upgrades do not introduce significant gas overhead.
